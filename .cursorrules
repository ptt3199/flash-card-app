# Cursor Terminal Configuration Rules

## Terminal Command Protocol

When running terminal commands through the run_terminal_cmd tool:

1. **Default**: Try running commands normally first
2. **If hanging occurs**: Use the simple prompt workaround below

### Hanging Workaround (if needed):

If commands get stuck in "generating..." state:

```bash
# Set simple prompt for the session
export PS1="➜ %1~ %# "
export PROMPT="➜ %1~ %# "
export RPS1=""
export RPROMPT=""

# Then run your command
your-command-here
```

### Alternative: One-liner approach
```bash
# Run command with simple prompt in one line
PS1="➜ %1~ %# " your-command-here
```

### Why This Works:

- Complex themes like PowerLevel10k can cause Cursor to hang
- Simple prompts allow proper command completion detection
- This gives manual control over when to use the workaround
- Maintains full theme functionality for manual terminal usage

### Available Functions (if defined in shell):

- `simple-prompt`: Switch to simple prompt
- `restore-prompt`: Restore PowerLevel10k theme

### Notes:

- Test commands normally first - many work fine with PowerLevel10k
- Only use the workaround when actual hanging occurs
- The simple prompt approach is more reliable than theme switching
- Remember that prompt changes only affect the current session

### Example Usage:

```bash
# Instead of just running:
npm install

# Always run:
simple-prompt && npm install

# For multiple commands:
simple-prompt && npm install && npm run dev

# To restore theme after (optional):
simple-prompt && npm install && restore-prompt
```

### Available Theme Aliases:

- `simple-prompt`: Switch to simple prompt
- `restore-prompt`: Restore PowerLevel10k theme

This approach gives you the best of both worlds: compatibility with Cursor AI and full theme functionality for manual use.
